Functional simulation, or pre-synthesis simulation, is the first and most critical step in verifying any digital design. Its objective is to validate the design's logic and behavior against the specification, irrespective of timing delays or physical implementation.

For the VSDBabySoC, the goal is to confirm the high-level operation and data integrity among the main IP blocks: the RVMYTH processor, the PLL , and the DAC.
