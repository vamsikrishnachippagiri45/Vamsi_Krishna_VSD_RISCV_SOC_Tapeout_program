# Circuit design and spice simulation 

## Introduction to SPICE Simulation

SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) is an industry-standard circuit simulator developed at UC Berkeley for analog and mixed-signal analysis. It solves circuit equations (using nodal analysis and Newton-Raphson methods) from a netlist to find voltages and currents at each node.

Types of Analyses:
DC Analysis: Finds steady-state operating point , 
AC Analysis: Analyzes frequency response (filters, amplifiers) , 
Transient Analysis: Studies time-domain behavior (waveforms, rise/fall times).

Why SPICE Simulations Are Needed in IC Design : 

1) To Understand Cell Delay:
Delay comes from internal transistor switching and output load capacitance (fanout + interconnects).
SPICE uses accurate transistor models to calculate true propagation delay under specific conditions (input slew & output load).

2) To Ensure Delay Models Are Accurate:
STA tools use pre-characterized delay tables (.lib) generated using SPICE simulations.
SPICE is the “gold standard” for building these models.

3) To Verify STA Results (Signoff):
SPICE verifies critical timing paths detected by STA.
Final signoff simulations (FastSPICE/full SPICE) ensure accurate timing before tapeout.

##  **Basic Circuit Element** : NMOS


### **1. NMOS – Basic Concept**

* **NMOS (N-channel MOSFET)** is a **voltage-controlled switch**.
* **Structure:**

  * Two **n+ regions** (Source & Drain) in a **p-type substrate**.
  * **Gate** is separated by a thin **oxide layer**.
* **Working:**

  * Current flows between **Source (S)** and **Drain (D)** when a voltage is applied at **Gate (G)**.
  * At **$V_{GS} = 0$**, no channel exists → **Transistor OFF** (high resistance).


### **2. Strong Inversion & Threshold Voltage ($V_t$)**

* When **Gate voltage ($V_{GS}$)** increases:

  * Electrons are attracted toward the Gate area.
  * A **depletion region** forms first.
  * At a certain $V_{GS}$, enough electrons accumulate → **n-channel forms**.
* This condition is called **Strong Inversion**.
* The **voltage at which this happens** is called **Threshold Voltage ($V_t$)**.

**Behavior:**

* If **$V_{GS} < V_t$ → OFF (no conduction)**
* If **$V_{GS} ≥ V_t$ → ON (channel formed, current flows)**



### **3. Body (Substrate) Effect**

* **Definition:** $V_t$ increases if there is a voltage difference between **Source (S)** and **Bulk (B)**.
* **Cause:** A positive **$V_{SB}$** (Source higher than Bulk) makes the **depletion region wider**, requiring a higher Gate voltage to invert the channel.
* **Result:**
  $$V_t ↑ \text{ when } V_{SB} ↑$$
  → Harder to turn ON the NMOS.

**Equation:**
[
V_t = V_{t0} + \gamma \left(\sqrt{|2\Phi_f + V_{SB}|} - \sqrt{|2\Phi_f|}\right)
]

| Symbol   | Meaning                         |
| :------- | :------------------------------ |
| $V_t$    | New threshold voltage           |
| $V_{t0}$ | Threshold voltage at $V_{SB}=0$ |
| $\gamma$ | Body effect coefficient         |
| $V_{SB}$ | Source-to-Bulk voltage          |
| $\Phi_f$ | Fermi potential                 |

**Summary:**

* **$V_{GS}$ controls NMOS conduction.**
* **$V_t$** = minimum voltage needed to form channel.
* **Body Effect:** Higher $V_{SB}$ → Higher $V_t$ → NMOS harder to turn ON.
