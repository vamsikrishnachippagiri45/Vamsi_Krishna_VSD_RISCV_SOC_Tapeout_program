# Day1 : Introduction to Verilog RTL Design and synthesis

## Simulator, Design and Testbench 
RTL (Register Transfer Level) design is checked for adherence to the specification by simulating the design.
A simulator tool is used to execute and verify the behavior of Verilog code before moving to synthesis.

We use Icarus Verilog (iverilog) simulator.

#### Design 
A Design is a set of Verilog RTL codes written to implement the intended functionality.
It describes the digital circuit behavior at register-transfer level.

Example: A multiplexer, adder, counter, etc.


#### Testbench : A Testbench is a separate Verilog code used to verify the design.
It does not represent actual hardware; instead, it: 1) Provides stimulus (inputs) to the design. 2) Monitors and checks the outputs of the design.

Testbenches help in ensuring that the design meets the functional specification.

#### How simulator work (Iverilog based simulation flow): 

The simulator mimics how the digital circuit behaves over time. It: Reads the design code (DUT â€“ Design Under Test), Reads the testbench code (stimulus + checks).

Compiles both into a simulation executable.
Runs the simulation and generates output (waveforms, logs, or results).

we use gtkwave for viewing output waveforms.
