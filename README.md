# Vamsi_Krishna_VSD_RISCV_SOC_Tapeout_program
Hands-on work from the VSD RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program. A 20-week industry-driven initiative covering the complete RTL-to-GDSII flow using Synopsys EDA tools and SCL180nm PDK. The program focuses on RISC-V based SoC design, physical implementation, sign-off, and real silicon tapeout, providing end-to-end VLSI design experience.

# 🖥️ RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program – VSD
RISC-V VSD Participants, India  

Welcome to my journey through the **SoC Tapeout Program (VSD)**!  

This repository captures my **week-by-week progress**, documenting the tasks, learnings, and insights.  

"In this program, we learn to design a **System-on-Chip (SoC)** from basic RTL to GDSII using open-source tools.  
It is part of India’s **largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative**, bringing together 3500+ participants to build silicon and contribute to the nation’s semiconductor ecosystem."
