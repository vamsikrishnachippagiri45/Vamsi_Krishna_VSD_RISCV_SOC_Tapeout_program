# Vamsi_Krishna_VSD_RISCV_SOC_Tapeout_program
Hands-on work from the VSD RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program. A 20-week industry-driven initiative covering the complete RTL-to-GDSII flow using Synopsys EDA tools and SCL180nm PDK. The program focuses on RISC-V based SoC design, physical implementation, sign-off, and real silicon tapeout, providing end-to-end VLSI design experience.
